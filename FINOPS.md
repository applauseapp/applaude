# FinOps - Financial Operations Strategy

This document outlines the production-ready FinOps strategy for the Applaude platform to manage, optimize, and forecast cloud costs effectively as we scale.

## 1. Core Principles

- **Cost-Aware Culture:** Every engineering decision will consider its cost implications.
- **Optimization by Design:** The architecture is designed to be scalable and cost-efficient from the start.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** We will continuously monitor our cloud spend to identify and address anomalies.

## 2. Cost Optimization Measures

### 2.1. AWS Auto Scaling

- **Elastic Beanstalk:** The production environment is configured with a CPU-based Auto Scaling policy.
  - **Scale-Out:** New instances are added when CPU utilization exceeds 75% to handle traffic spikes.
  - **Scale-In:** Instances are removed aggressively when CPU utilization drops below 25% to minimize costs during idle periods.
- **RDS Read Replicas:** Auto-scaling will be implemented for RDS read replicas to handle database load spikes.

### 2.2. Resource Tagging Policy

All AWS resources **must** be tagged with the following for cost allocation and tracking:

- `Project`: The name of the project (`Applaude`).
- `Environment`: The deployment environment (`production`, `staging`, `development`).
- `Owner`: The team or individual responsible for the resource.

## 3. Budgets and Alerting

### 3.1. AWS Budgets

- **Setup:** An AWS Budget is configured to monitor our total monthly spend.
- **Alerting:**
  - An alert is triggered when the **actual spend** reaches 80% of the monthly budget.
  - A proactive alert is triggered when the **forecasted spend** is projected to exceed 100% of the monthly budget.
- **Notifications:** Alerts are sent to the engineering leadership and FinOps team via SNS and email.

*To configure this, navigate to **AWS Budgets** in the AWS Management Console, create a new budget, and set up the alert thresholds as described above.*

## 4. Reporting and Governance

- **Monthly Cost Reviews:** The engineering team will conduct monthly reviews of our cloud spend to identify optimization opportunities.
- **Cost Anomaly Detection:** AWS Cost Anomaly Detection is enabled to automatically identify unusual spending patterns.

By implementing this FinOps strategy, we will maintain control over our cloud costs while ensuring the platform can scale to meet the demands of 100 million users.
