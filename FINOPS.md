# FinOps - Financial Operations

This document outlines the FinOps strategy for the Applaude platform to manage and optimize cloud costs.

## Resource Tagging Policy

All AWS resources must be tagged with the following tags:

* `Project`: The name of the project the resource belongs to (e.g., `Applaude`).
* `Environment`: The environment the resource belongs to (e.g., `production`, `staging`, `development`).
* `Owner`: The name of the person or team responsible for the resource.

## AWS Budgets and Billing Alerts

* **AWS Budgets:** Set up monthly budgets to monitor and control cloud spending.
* **Billing Alerts:** Configure billing alerts in Amazon CloudWatch to receive notifications when spending exceeds a certain threshold.

By implementing these FinOps best practices, we can ensure that we are using our cloud resources efficiently and cost-effectively.
