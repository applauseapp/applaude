# API Versioning Strategy

This document outlines the API versioning strategy for the Applaude platform. Our goal is to provide a stable and predictable API for developers while allowing us to evolve and improve our services.

## Versioning Scheme

All API endpoints are versioned using a URI path prefix, e.g., `/api/v1/`.

- **Major Versions (`/v1/`, `/v2/`)**: Indicate breaking changes. When a new major version is released, the previous version will be supported for a limited time.
- **Minor and Patch Versions**: We do not use minor or patch versions in the URI. Non-breaking changes (e.g., adding new optional parameters or new fields to responses) will be introduced to the latest major version.

## Breaking Changes

A change is considered "breaking" if it can potentially break a client's integration. This includes:

- Removing an endpoint.
- Removing or renaming a field in a response.
- Adding a new required field to a request.
- Changing the data type of a field.
- Changing authentication or authorization requirements.

When we introduce breaking changes, we will release a new major version of the API (e.g., `/v2/`).

## Deprecation Policy

When a new major version of the API is released, the previous version will be deprecated. We will provide a minimum of **6 months** of support for deprecated API versions.

During the deprecation period, we will:

1.  **Announce the deprecation**: We will notify developers via email, our blog, and in the API documentation.
2.  **Provide migration guides**: Clear documentation will be provided to help developers migrate to the new API version.
3.  **Monitor usage**: We will monitor the usage of the deprecated API version and may reach out to developers who have not yet migrated.

After the deprecation period, the old API version will be decommissioned and will no longer be available.

## Communication

All API changes will be communicated through the following channels:

- **Developer Changelog**: A dedicated changelog will document all changes to the API.
- **Email Notifications**: Registered developers will receive email notifications about upcoming changes and deprecations.
- **Blog Posts**: Major changes and new versions will be announced on our official blog.

We are committed to providing a stable and reliable API and will make every effort to minimize disruptions for our developers.
